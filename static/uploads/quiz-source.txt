What Is Authorization?
Authorization in system security is the process of giving the user
permission to access a specific resource or function. This term is often
used interchangeably with access control or client privilege.
Giving someone permission to download a particular file on a server or
providing individual users with administrative access to an application
are good examples of authorization.
In secure environments, authorization must always follow authentication.
Users should first prove that their identities are genuine before an
organizationâ€™s administrators grant them access to the requested
resources.
